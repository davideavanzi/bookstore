## Specifications
### Web Architecture
*Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application and how
they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application layer, data layer
or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is not rendered server side?*

The web architecture of our application consist in a typical three-layer MVC setup hereby described:
- The **data layer** is a PostgreSQL database, accessed by the application layer by the mean of the query builder Knex.js. Database setup is carried out by applying knex.js migrations and seeds at the application start. 
- The **application layer** consists of a nodeJS server handling out API requests and interacting with the data layer. In our deployment the nodeJS server runs behind an Nginx reverse proxy hosted on a Ubuntu server, thus providing HTTPS connection.
- The **presentation layer** is an HTML website performing API AJAX calls to the server using JQuery and JavaScript.

This is a diagram representation of our high-level architecture:

### API
#### REST compliance
*Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are the
reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must not describe
the whole API here, just the design decisions.*

We designed a RESTful API following it's principles at our best, with two exceptions:
- **Uniform Interface**: we defined all the needed resources thorugh proper URLs, trying to separate logical entities as much as possible and giving them a specific path in the interface. 
- **Clientâ€“server**: we mantained a complete separation between client and server, they can be altered and developed separately as long as the API interface is not modified.
- **Stateless**: the application is completely stateless and all the informations about the state are kept on the client. Each request is processed as new and a cookie is verified in order to authorize some requests. We decided to also make a little exception to this rule, storing an authorization token on the server side as a good practice to prevent cookie tampering attacks. This feature is optional and not necessary for the basic operation of the API interface.
- **Layered system**: The three layers are completely separated and can work indepentently, just by changing the connection parameters and urls.
- **Cacheable**: Since the data obtained by this API may vary in short amount of times (E.G. stock amount of books, new events and reviews) we decided not to make requests cacheable. Although in a real-world application some of the requests may be cached.

#### OpenAPI Resource models
*Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for resources.*

We introduced the following models to exchange informations through the API:

- **Book**: This is the main book model, and contains references to its authors, genre and themes.
- **Author**: This model represents an author.
- **Event**: This model contains informations about an event in which a specific book is presented.
- **Cart**: This model contains informations about the books that an user is willing to buy.
- **User**: This model represents the user object, associated to a customer of the store. 
- **Login**: This is used in order to echange login and cookie informations.
- **Reservation**: This model represents the willing of a customer to reserve a book which is currently out of stock in the store (Not required by the assignment).
- **Review**: This model contains a review made by a customer on a specific book.
- **Interview**: This model contains an interview made to an author of a book
- **Theme**: This model represents a theme: a single book may have more than one theme.
- **Genre**: This model represents a genre: a book only has one genre.


### Data model

*Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model*?

Here we include the Entity-Relationship diagram that describes our data layer. Each of these entities is mapped to a model in the OpenAPI specification: relations are then used to provide logical links betwen said entities.

**Note:** the parts of this diagram outlined in blue represent functionalities that were not required (such as the ability to make a reservation for an out-of-stock book) but we decided to include and design for the sake of completeness. Therefore, these features will not be fully implemented in our application.

## Implementation
### Tools used
*Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the backend
of the application.*

Tools used to develop the backend part:
- **Editors/IDE**: Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Swagger Editor
- **Languages**: JavaScript, SQL (on a knex raw query)
- **Frameworks**: NodeJS, Knex.js

### Discussion
*Describe here:*
- *How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI
  specification?*

  The server checks validates any request by comparing it to its OpenAPI specification via the swagger middleware. All server JSON replies are compliant to the entities specified in the yaml representation.
- *Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition
  the web application (static assets vs. application data)?*
  
  All static assets are served to clients by the node serve-static module. Application data are then exchanged by AJAX requests made by the client and displayed by the presentation layer.

- *Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the
  state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc..).*

  We decided to manage the user session as following: 
  the login happens when the specified POST request is made to the API: the system creates an HTTPOnly cookie for the user that made the request. This cookie is composed by the id of the user, a field called loggedIn (set to true) and a particular session token which is also stored in the server database. The expiration of the cookie is set by default to 24 hours, but if the user checks "remember me" when performing login the expiration will be 30 days. Once logged in,the system checks the user's authentication by verifying the correctness of the cookie, the token stored inside it (compared to the one in the database) and the relative signature in order to ensure that the cookie hasn't been tampered with.
  When a logout GET action is performed by a user, the system firstly checks wether the request comes with a session token: if so, it overwrites the db-stored token with a new random one and then empties the session token, thus voiding the user's ability to authenticate again with that cookie.

- *Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing
  the data model?*

  The data model is managed by a PostgreSQL relational database. Interaction with the application layer happens via the Knex.js query builder.

### Task assignment
*Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members of the
group*

Here is a table reporting how much time each group member spent on the different tasks.

### Analysis of existing API

*Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI specification and why (at least two).*

Before defining our own OpenAPI specification, we studied and took inspiration from the following APIS:
- Swagger Petstore API for a clear and simple specification example, found at [this address](https://petstore.swagger.io/).
- DataAtWork APIs for examples on entities and path relationships, found at [this address](http://api.dataatwork.org/v1/spec/).
- Google Books APIs for examples on a books-related specification, found at [this address](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview).

### Learning outcome
*What was the most important thing all the members have learned while developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered, how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?*

- Davide learnt the JavaScript language, how to run a proper NodeJS server and the principles of a RESTful API. He will further explore this topic in order to use it on future real world projects and works.

Examples:
- Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know more about caching, he's probably going to create his own startup with what she has learned
- Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked to know
  more about promises for asynchronous code..
