## Specification
### Web Architecture
Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application and how
3
they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application layer, data layer
or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is not rendered server side?
### API
#### REST compliance
Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are the
reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must not describe
the whole API here, just the design decisions.
#### OpenAPI Resource models
Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for resources.
### Data model
Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?
## Implementation
### Tools used
Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the backend
of the application.
### Discussion
Describe here:
- How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided OpenAPI
  specification?
- Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to partition
  the web application (static assets vs. application data)
- Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what are the
  state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc..).
- Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for managing
  the data model?
## Other information
### Task assignment
Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members of the
group, e.g.:
- Foo worked on front end (80%) and OpenAPI Spec (20% of the time)
- Bar worked on ....
### Analysis of existing API
4

Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI
specification and why (at least two).
### Learning outcome
What was the most important thing all the members have learned while developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered, how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?
Examples:
- Foo learned to write SQL queries and Javascript but wanted to know more about caching, he's probably going to create his own startup with what she has learned
- Bar learned how to deploy on a cloud platform, he would have liked to know
  more about promises for asynchronous code..
4.2 Template for emails sent to the instructor concerning problems with the backend
To streamline the resolution of problems, we highly recommend to fill up this form with the description of the issue you are having.
We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
## Team
- Team administrator name; email
- Team member n.1 name; email
- Team member n.2 name; email
## Relevant links
Put here the link to your repository. Invite one of the teachers as
administrators/members of the team in order for them to be able to
access it.
## What are you trying to achieve
-   Goal: *describe what are you trying to achieve here*
-   Complete, non-ambiguous steps to reproduce the issue from your repo.
    These are the steps that the teachers will follow when trying investigate
    your issue; if it is a command line invocation, please copy and paste the
    complete command with its arguments, options etc..
    1.  *describe step 1 here*
    2.  *describe step 2 here*
    3.  ...
-   Expected results: *what is your expected outcome*
5

## Describe what you get
- Actual results: *what outcome do you get instead?*. Remember, "It doesn't work" is not a problem statement.
-   Do you get any error message, log, stack trace? put it here
           COPY THE ERROR MESSAGE, INCLUDING STACK TRACE HERE
